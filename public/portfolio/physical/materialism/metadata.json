  "description": "In my first year in LMA, during the very first semester, each of us was given a topic, randomly assigned among everyone in the course. I received the philosophical direction of Materialism. I chose to explore it not so much through working directly with materials, but from a more philosophical perspective. The works are titled 'Glacier' and 'Cross'.",
