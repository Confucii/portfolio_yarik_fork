          What I Do
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          I work across multiple creative fields, constantly exploring new techniques and pushing the boundaries
          of what's possible. Each project in my portfolio represents a unique challenge and learning opportunity.

          My Approach
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          I believe in the power of continuous learning and experimentation. Every project, from my first 3D render
          to my latest work, is a step in an ongoing creative journey. I value both technical excellence and
          artistic expression, striving to balance both in everything I create.
